<h2> Digital Media Class </h2>
<p> Throughout the begining and middle of the school year, I have had an incredible experience in my digital media class. I have been able to interact with my peers and collaborate with them to create and complete projects such as, "Visual Storytelling" and  "Scavenger Hunt Photography". I have been able to enhance my skills and knowledge about the use of AI and Adobe Creative Cloud in this class. In addition, the documentary on social media and the developement of algorithims was able to bring awareness to us students about the manipulation of social media.Overall, I have been able to learn a great deal in my digital media class.</p>
